## About
In the hospitality industry, booking cancellations pose significant challenges to revenue management, operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction. Despite the implementation of various customer engagement strategies and flexible booking policies, the unpredictability and frequency of cancellations continue to disrupt forecasting accuracy, inventory control, and financial stability. Additionally, hotels experience considerable financial losses due to cancellations, which manifest as lost revenue from unoccupied rooms, increased operational costs, and diminished profitability.

This analysis delves into the multifaceted factors influencing cancellation rates, leveraging advanced statistical techniques and to develop a machine learning classification model to predict hotel booking cancellations patterns and actionable insights. By leveraging historical booking data and various features associated with each booking record, I aim to analyze and develop a predictive model that can classify bookings into "Canceled" (1) or "Not Canceled" (0) categories. This model will help hotel managers allocate resources more effectively and optimize inventory management to reduce potential revenue loss due to cancellations.
